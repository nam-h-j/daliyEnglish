## Web-based minisereies gaining popularity

```
A new trend has emerged in the drama industry in South Korea,
one of the most wired countries in the world.

in this fast-paced, smartphone-savvy society, many people are no longer
watching their favorite dramas through the traditionla medium of TV.

Instead, they're watching shows on their smartphones. This has led to the
birth of a new genre -Web dramas.

Web dramas, consisting of 10- to 15-minute-long episode available only
on the interney, started out as a marketing tool for large conglomerates
and public organizations.

But they're now becoming mainstreame.

The government unveiled a plan to nurture the new genre as a driver
of hallyu, and major broadcasters have already jumped into the game.

The Korean Creative Content Agency recently signed a meorandum of
understanding with Naver, the nation's largest portal site, to help
liven up its Web-based content, mainly through drama series.
