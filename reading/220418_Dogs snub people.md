## Dogs snub people who are mean to their owners

---

Dogs do not like people who are mean to their owners, Japanese researchers said, and will refuse food offered by people who have snubbed their master.
The findings reveal that canines have the capacity to cooperate socially - a characteristic found in a relatively small number of species, including humans and some other primates.
