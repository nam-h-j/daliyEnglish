## Koreans fall for bread

---

A hot, steamy bowl of rice was long considered an irreplacealbe staple in Korean breakfast.
"You manage a day with the power of rice."
Korean moms would tell their kids, encouraging them to finish their meal. This ceunturies-old, typical morning scene is changing rapidly now.
Bread, which arrived in Korea through Japan only in the 19th century, is fast emerging as a tasty and convenient alternative to rice. While bread consumption has been on a solid rise, that of rice fell to its lowest level in 2014.
