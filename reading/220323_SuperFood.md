## What is SuperFood?

```
Superfoods have become a permanent fixture in the shopping bags of
health-conscious Koreans, who are known for catching on fast to new
global trends.
The term "superfood" appeared in the 2007 book "SuperFoods Rx,"
written by renowned American ophthalmologist Steven Pratt.
The author outlined 14 functional foods including blueberries,
tomatoes and wild salmon that should be eaten in combination with
otehr foods for maximum health benfits.
Now "superfood" no longer refers to specific food items.
The word is considered an effective marketing tool to lure consumers
willing to spend big on healthy eating.
