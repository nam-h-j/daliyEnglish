## Queen marks ceremonial birthday as Price George debuts on balcony

```
Queen Elizabeth II marked her ceremonial birthday Saturday with the traditional
"Trooping the Color" parade in the heart of London and 23-month-old Prince George made his debut on the Buckingham Palace balcony.
The queen turned 89 on April 21, her actual birth date, which is traditionally marked in private, with a public celebration held in June,
when London's fickle weather is more likely to be favorable.
