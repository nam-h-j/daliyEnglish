## Money and Happiness

```
They say money can't buy happiness. They're wrong. At least up to a point.
Researchers said people's emotional well-being -happiness- increases along with their income up to about $75,000
The researchers reviewed surveys of 450,000 Americans conducted in 2008 and 2009.
The surveys included questions on people's day-to-day happiness and their overall life satisfaction.
Happiness got better as income rose but the effect leveled out at $75,000.
