The foreign ministers of South Korea and Japan held talks in Tokyo on Sunday to forge much-needed momentum to mend bilateral relations that have been strained amid escalating historical and territorial feuds.

It was the first visit by Seoul's top diplomat since the Park Geun-hye administration was inaugurated in February 2013.
